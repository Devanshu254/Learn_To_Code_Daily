# Introduction to dynamic programming.
> Dynamic Programming is an optimization over plain recursion. The idea is to reuse the solution of sub problems when there are overlapping sub problems.
## There are two ways to perform DP.
> **1. Memoization (Top Down).** <br>
> **2. Tabulation (Bottom up).**
## Applications of DP.
> **Bellman Ford Algorithm:** This algorithm is to find shortest path from a source to all the destination. This algorithm is used in routing. <br>
> **Floyd warshall algorithm:** To find the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a graph. <br>
> **Diff Utility (LCS - Longest common subsequence):** If we want to know the differences between two files, we uses it in git. We want to figure out what all changes we have made before committing the changes. <br>
> **Searched Closed Words (Edit Distance)**: We have a word which is not present in dictionary but we are trying to find it out in dictionary, we want to find out closest word. <br>
> **Resource Allocation (0-1 Knapsack):** We have some financial constraints, we have some budget and we have some things that we want to acquire which things to be acquired, and everything has some costs how do you make optimal decisions.
